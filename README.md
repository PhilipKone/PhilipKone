## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I have a background in Biomedical Engineering and I love research in areas such as Data Science and AI. 

I have 2+ years of experience, specializing in computational modeling, simulation, and data analysis. I enhanced research reliability by 30% through dataset expansion and developed innovative algorithms for gait analysis in my previous role. I am skilled in mathematical modeling, algorithm development, and data processing, with expertise in MATLAB, Python, Excel, and IBM SPSS. I am actively involved in cutting-edge projects like sensor fusion algorithmsâ€”a strong communicator and team player, with leadership experience. Let's connect and drive innovation together!
